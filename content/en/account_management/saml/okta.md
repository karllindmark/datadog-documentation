## Overview

This page tells you how to set up the Datadog application in Okta. 

Before proceeding, make sure that you are using the latest version of the Datadog application:
1. Open the general settings in Okta.
2. Look for a field labeled **SSO Base URL**

If **SSO Base URL** appears, you are using the latest version. If not, configure Okta using the [legacy instructions][1].
